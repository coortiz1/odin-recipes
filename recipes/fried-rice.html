        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring 3 cups water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat
                to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water
                has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside and let cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over 
                medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 
                about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 
                minute. Mix in cooked jasmine rice and frozen peas-carrot mixture; 
                fry until rice begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons 
                butter and stir to combine. Pour in eggs and cook until firm. Add 
                oyster sauce, soy sauce, and 1/2 lemon juice; stir to combine. Season 
                with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a separate pan over medium-high 
                heat. Add shrimp and fry until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat 
                is opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and lemon juice. 
                Combine with fried rice mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine mayonnaise, water, paprika, ginger paste, white sugar, garlic powder, salt, 
                and pepper in a bowl to make the yum yum sauce. Stir well. Serve with the fried rice.
