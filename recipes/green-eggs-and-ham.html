        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a famous fictional dish invented 
            by Dr. Seuss. Do you believe Sam-I-Am that 
            the food is good? Try it out yourself!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> large eggs</li>
            <li>2 slices of ham</li>
            <li>green food coloring</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>canola oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Take two eggs and separate the yolks from the whites. 
                Gently cradle one yolk in your hand and add one small 
                drop of green food coloring.  Gently spread the color 
                with your fingers until the yolk is colored.  Repeat 
                this with the other yolk. Dab off any excess with a towel 
                or it will leak into the whites.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a pan on medium low heat and add 1 tbsp of canola oil. 
                I find this process is easier when cooked on low heat. Add 
                the whites. When the whites begin to firm gently lay the 
                yolks on top. Cover with a lid and allow to cook through 
                to what you prefer.
            </li>

                This park is optional but in Green Eggs and Ham, the ham was 
                green. I simply dapped a bit of green food coloring on the ham 
                but I know some prefer their ham without the color.
            </li>
        </ol>
