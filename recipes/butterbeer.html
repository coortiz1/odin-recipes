        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is Butterbeer, a drink enjoyed by all wizards!
            It has a very distinct butterscotch taste.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 bottles of ale</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>5 egg yolks (save the whites for something like meringue)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into chunks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat the ale and spices in a medium saucepan, over medium heat.
                If it has a lot of foam, that should die down once it starts 
                heating up.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl, combine the sugar and egg yolks. while 
                whisking furiously, pour in a ladle-full of the hot ale.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk until it’s incorporated, then pour the whole mess back into 
                the pot of ale, still whisking madly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep the mixture just under a simmer, stirring until it thickens 
                somewhat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the chunks of butter and stir until they’re melted. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk with a hand mixer (or a lot of arm strength), until a 
                foam rises. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve hot, in heat-proof mugs.
            </li>
        </ol>
